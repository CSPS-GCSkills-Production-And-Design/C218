<h1>The Federal Government</h1>
    <h2>Powers of the Federal Government</h2>
    <p>The <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-12">federal level of government</a> has power over matters affecting Canada as a whole, such as national defence, criminal law, central bank and monetary policy, foreign relations, passports, and postal service.</p>
    <p>Some areas come under shared federal and provincial jurisdiction. The federal government controls national transportation matters such as regulations related to aviation, marine and rail transport. In contrast, the provinces have jurisdiction over provincial highways, vehicle registration, and driver licensing.</p>
    <h2>Branches of the Federal Government</h2>
    <p>The federal government has three branches:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Judicial branch: the Courts </li>
        <li>Legislative: the Crown, the Senate and the House of Commons</li>
        <li>Executive: the Crown, the Prime Minister and the Cabinet.</li>
    </ul>

                            	<p>The governor general, on the advice of the Prime Minister, has the power to dissolve Parliament and call an election. The <em>Constitution Acts</em> of 1867 and 1982 set the maximum time between federal general elections at five years, except in time of real or apprehended war, invasion or insurrection.</p>
                                <p>A new government is formed after a general election, when candidates from different political parties are elected from across Canada to serve their constituents as Members of Parliament.</p>
                                <p>The leader of the party that wins the largest number of seats in the House of Commons is asked by the governor general to form the new government and becomes Prime Minister.</p>
