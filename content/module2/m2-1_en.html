    <h1>Canada, a Constitutional Monarchy</h1>
    <p>Long before 1867, Canada was inhabited by distinct Indigenous Peoples, divided into separate, independent nations with institutions of their own, governing themselves by their own laws.</p>
    <p>Canada is a constitutional monarchy, a federation, and a democracy. The <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-3"><em>Constitution Act, 1867</em></a>, provides that there shall be one Parliament for Canada, consisting of three distinct elements: the Crown, the Senate, and the House of Commons.</p>
    <p>The <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-4">Monarchy and the Crown</a>, represented by the <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-5">Governor General</a>, is the head of state. The responsibility for lawmaking in Canada is shared among one federal, ten provincial, and three territorial governments.</p>
