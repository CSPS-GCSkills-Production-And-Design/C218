    <h1>The Public Service</h1>
    <p>The Public Service of Canada is the largest component of the executive branch. Public servants work to translate the declarations and definitions of public policy into action. As a public servant, you have a duty to loyally implement the public policy direction of the elected government of the day. You must give honest and impartial advice and make all information relevant to a decision available to ministers, but once the ministers have made lawful decisions, you must loyally implement them.</p>

                <p>The Privy Council Office (<abbr>PCO</abbr>) is led by the Clerk of the Privy Council, the most senior federal public servant. The <abbr>PCO</abbr> assists the Clerk in providing professional, non-partisan support to the Prime Minister in the Prime Minister’s responsibilities as head of government, including management of senior-level appointments. The Clerk of the Privy Council has three primary roles: deputy minister to the Prime Minister, Secretary to the Cabinet, and head of the public service. In effect, the Privy Council Office is the Prime Minister’s department, and the Clerk its deputy minister.</p>

                <p>Agents of Parliament provide service on behalf of Parliament. They are responsible directly to Parliament rather than to the government or a federal minister.

                <p>Examples of agents include the Office of the Auditor General, the Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages, the Office of the Information Commissioner of Canada, and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.</p>

                <summary>Crown Corporations</summary>
                <p>Crown corporations function like government-owned companies. Some are financially independent. Others partly rely on the financial support of government for their operation and are subject to the Financial Administration Act. They are operated by boards of directors whose members are named by the government; some are expected to pay dividends to the Crown. Treasury Board reviews their corporate plans.</p>
