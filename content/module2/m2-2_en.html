	<h1>Provincial, Territorial, Municipal and Indigenous Governments</h1>

	<p>Provincial governments make laws and exercise powers over local matters, as set out in the <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-6">Constitution</a>. They have jurisdiction in such areas as education, health care, property rights, the administration of justice, natural resources, and municipalities.</p>

	<p>The territorial governments (<a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-7">Yukon</a>, <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-8">Northwest Territories</a>, and <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-9">Nunavut</a>) are equivalent to provincial governments in most matters, but their roles and responsibilities have evolved; this is best reflected in the decentralization agreements they have signed with the federal government. This decentralization has resulted in greater local control for the Northern governments.</p>

	<p>Municipal governments (cities, towns, villages, counties, districts, and metropolitan regions) are set up by provincial governments, who also decide what powers they will hold. There are about 4000 municipal governments in Canada. They provide services such as water supply, sewage and garbage disposal, roads, sidewalks, street lighting, building codes, parks, playgrounds, and libraries.</p>

	<p>Many types of governance models exist for Indigenous Peoples, and governance structures among Indigenous communities are at different stages of development. Some communities have self government agreements with Canada while others have minimal governance structures. Self government agreements give Indigenous groups greater control and law-making authority over a comprehensive range of jurisdictions, such as governance, social and economic development, education, health, lands and more. </p>
