  <h1>Public Servants Collaborating</h1>
  <p>Collaboration is key to the success of any long-term project or initiative. Watch how one public servant collaborates with his fellow workers on a department-to-department level as well as with his provincial partners.</p>

        <h2 class="h4">Federal departments, in collaboration with the provinces and territories, play a vital role in monitoring and improving the country's climate and environment.</h2>
        <p>I&rsquo;m a Science Officer at Environment and Climate Change Canada.</p>
        <p>So… you want me to describe what I do?</p>
        <p>Well… yesterday was pretty much a Kodak moment!</p>
        <p>In fact, I wanted to take a group shot for a team picture… 
          because it was a perfect example of a pretty much perfect day! </p>
        <p>You see, my team works on improving water quality.</p>
        <p>Water is our most precious natural resource, and both the Federal government 
          and the provinces have made it a long term priority to improve Canada&rsquo;s lakes, rivers, and oceans too.</p>
        <p>Now on the St. Lawrence, certain products and by-products have created unintended circumstances 
          by making their way in to the River and shores over the years, 
          and have also contaminated surrounding wetlands, like Lake St. Pierre.</p>
        <p>And we&rsquo;re tackling that with full force - a dream scenario for a biologist.</p>
        <p>I remember sitting in first year biochemistry 
          thinking of how or when all this was going to be put in to practice.</p>
        <p>And now…I&rsquo;m doing it!</p>
        <p>Anyway… back to yesterday!!</p>
        <p>I started out by picking up my gear and supplies, met up with my team 
          and headed out to the collection site on the St. Lawrence. </p>
        <p>We normally spend the morning doing a series of onsite tests.</p>
        <p>So there we were, heading back out to the collection site for more samples. </p>
        <p>And by the way, we&rsquo;re speaking nothing but French.</p>
        <p>Maybe not a big deal to some people, but huge for me – I&rsquo;m from Saskatchewan and I&rsquo;m still learning!</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s critical - I need to make sure that I can talk with people 
          in the language of their choice and in this region, it tends to be French.</p>
        <p>By the way, we often have students from France and various Quebec universities, 
          so it&rsquo;s a pretty lively environment as well as a great &ldquo;language lab&rdquo;!</p>
        <p>Around 1 o&rsquo;clock we get back to the office where our main labs are.</p>
        <p>We select samples according to different analytical protocols.</p>
        <p>3 o&rsquo;clock rolls around and the Research manager asks for an update 
          so he can brief up the Regional Director responsible for this initiative, 
          and the Director General of Water Science and Technology responsible 
          for water quality monitoring and research.</p>
        <p> Done… and done.</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear that a lot of people are really interested in this work.</p>
        <p>The government of Canada has enlisted the help from the departments of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, 
          Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Health Canada, Parks Canada Agency, 
          Public Health Agency of Canada and us, Environment and Climate change Canada.</p>
        <p>And… the government of Quebec has enlisted help from five of their departments, too.</p>
        <p>Just to close off the day yesterday, I talked to my provincial counterpart 
          for planning a joint field campaign including working in tributaries of the St.&nbsp;Lawrence, 
          then we all headed up to tell the regional director 
          and our <abbr>DG</abbr> about how far we&rsquo;ve come and the successes of the project.</p>
        <p>Whenever I start talking about what we do here and why we do it, people&rsquo;s eyes just light up.</p>
        <p>Maybe because it&rsquo;s an example of how we can cooperate and get amazing stuff done.</p>
        <p>So… I&rsquo;m working on a great file, I&rsquo;m working in environmental science, I&rsquo;m working outdoors, 
          I&rsquo;m on a project that is critical to Canada&rsquo;s future… 
          and I get to work on my French every day.</p>
        <p>Not bad, right?</p>
