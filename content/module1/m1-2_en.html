                    <h2>Minister</h2>
                    <p>Cabinet ministers are selected by the Prime Minister based on their experience and their capacity to represent the diversity of the Canadian population. Ministers are accountable to the Prime Minister and to Parliament for departmental policies and programs. They ensure that their departments act on the political priorities of the day.</p>
                    <p>Ministers are responsible to the Prime Minister for the stewardship of their offices and to Cabinet for bringing forward new policy initiatives on behalf of their departments.</p>

                    <h2>Chief of Staff</h2>
                    <p>The chief of staff of the minister’s office provides political advice and support to the minister and is responsible for the overall management of the minister’s office.</p>
                    <p>The offices of the ministers across the government work closely with the Prime Minister’s Office (<abbr>PMO</abbr>). Members of a minister's exempt staff are appointed by the minister and are excluded from the appointing procedures of the public service (pursuant to section 128 of the <em>Public Service Employment Act</em>).</p>

                    <h2>Deputy Minister</h2>
                    <p>Appointed by the Prime Minister, the deputy minister (<abbr>DM</abbr>) is the most senior non-partisan public servant in a department. </p>
                    <p>Deputies are responsible for the overall leadership and management of their department. They provide technical, managerial, legal, and financial advice to their minister. Expected to be operationally focused, they must be politically sensitive while maintaining their political neutrality; they are prohibited from engaging in political activity by the <em>Public Service Employment Act</em>. </p>
                    <p>Responsible for delivering the department’s services to the public, the deputy minister is simultaneously accountable to the minister of the department, the Prime Minister, the Clerk of the Privy Council, the Public Service Commission, and Treasury Board. </p>
                    <p>In addition to liaising with the minister’s office, the deputy minister maintains a close working relationship with the Privy Council Office (<abbr>PCO</abbr>). </p>

                    <h2>Assistant Deputy Minister</h2>
                    <p>Responsibilities within a department are hierarchical, with each level generally becoming more operational in nature.</p>
                    <p>Assistant Deputy Ministers (<abbr>ADM</abbr>s) are among the most senior public servants in a department. They are appointed based on merit under the <em>Public Service Employment Act</em> by the authority of the Public Service Commission (usually delegated to deputy ministers). They are career public servants responsible for the day-to-day management of the department. They develop policy, carry out analysis, and manage programs, people, and resources.</p>
                    <p>A department generally has several <abbr>ADM</abbr>s. They may also be known as vice presidents under certain circumstances.</p>
                    <p><abbr>ADM</abbr>s manage areas such as communications, programs, policy, operations, research, audit and evaluation, human resources, and finance. Together with directors general (<abbr>DG</abbr>s), they form a senior management team, which is headed by the deputy minister. This team meets regularly to discuss collective issues, coordinate the broad agenda of the department, and negotiate discretionary funding.</p>

                    <p>In the video we watched earlier, we saw some of the functional areas of a department. Each of them is headed by an assistant deputy minister or director general. </p>
                    <p>Examples of the functional areas of a department include communications, finance, human resources, information technology, and security.</p>

                    <h2>Regional Services </h2>
                    <p>The role of the regional office is to manage the department’s local operations. In large operational departments, the senior public servants in regions generally occupy the assistant deputy minister level, but they may also be called <em>deputy commissioners or regional commissioners</em> by departments such as the Canada Revenue Agency or the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. They are responsible for the department’s operations in a given region, especially front-line service delivery and maintaining contacts with regional community groups and other stakeholders. They represent a region’s interests in Ottawa and ensure the region understands and implements national priorities.</p>
