            <h2 class="h4">The first day in a new job can be pretty overwhelming for anyone regardless of the workplace.</h2>
			<p>I&rsquo;m a science  program officer at Fisheries and Oceans Canada 
(also known as  <abbr>DFO</abbr>) in the Maritimes Region. </p>
            <p> I&rsquo;ve only been  here for about six months, but I absolutely love my job – and today, 
            I am helping a  new employee transition to <abbr>DFO</abbr> through our departmental orientation program.</p>
            <p>  She&rsquo;s brand new – just like I was six months ago, 
            having just  moved here from Montreal into my first full-time government job. </p>
            <p>  So I pretty  much know what this new person – her name is Jolene – is going through this morning.</p>
            <p>The first day  can be pretty overwhelming for anyone, regardless of the workplace, 
            so the  Government of Canada aims to make the first day transition as smooth as  possible. </p>
            <p> As Jolene and I  are about to take the elevator to the Science Branch, two people join us. </p>
            <p> And not just  ANY two people, but our manager and our regional director.</p>
            <p> I really can&rsquo;t resist taking the opportunity to  introduce Jolene 
            to them, so I  do it! </p>
            <p> They seem  pleased to meet her so we all had a brief chat on the way up to five.</p>
            <p> Afterwards,  Jolene and I make our way to the Science Branch where we have our weekly  meeting.</p>
            <p> This meeting is  a great opportunity for Jolene as she will get a chance to meet new people, 
              and get a real  understanding of the work we do in the region, 
              how the local  offices report to the regional office, 
            and how the  regional office reports to headquarters. </p>
            <p> Before I know  it, it is time for lunch, so we decide to head to the cafeteria.</p>
            <p> There&rsquo;s a little group of us that always  get together for lunch. </p>
            <p> We all play  Ultimate on the same team, 
            and we all  worked on the Government of Canada Charitable Workplace Campaign together. </p>
            <p> Denise is on  the Communications team, 
              and she  explained how they do everything from internal work 
            to  stakeholder-focused communications, plus media enquiries.  </p>
            <p> She loves it  because it&rsquo;s flat out  all the time!</p>
            <p> Raj works in  Human Resources. </p>
            <p> They do  everything from organizational planning to job postings to pay and benefits. </p>
            <p> Tony works with  Security.  </p>
            <p> He helps  employees get their security passes and identification cards. </p>
            <p> Allison works  in Finance, where she oversees the regional budget, 
              and Max is on  the Information Technology team - or <abbr>IT</abbr> - 
            that is focused  on things like activating e-mail accounts or providing access to  computers.  </p>
            <p> After lunch, I  deliver Jolene back to her new team and say goodbye. </p>
            <p> After even half  a day, I have a really good feeling that she&rsquo;s going to fit in well, 
            and bring a lot  to the team…</p>
            <p> …not just because  she understands the structure and the functional areas, 
              but because she  really got to see for herself that <abbr>DFO</abbr> is a family… 
            just like I  did.</p>
