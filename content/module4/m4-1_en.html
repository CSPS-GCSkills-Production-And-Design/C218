        <h2 class="h4">The Government of Canada's relationships with its provinces and territories are very important.</h2>
        <p>I&rsquo;m 37, Bachelor in Environmental Studies, born in Toronto, 
          living in Edmonton working for Natural Resources Canada, and loving it.</p>
        <p>So you&rsquo;re asking me what I do: good question.  </p>
        <p> I think the best description is that I solve puzzles, 
          but the puzzles have to do with people and organizations and policy. </p>
        <p>And one of the coolest files I am working on relates to a Memorandum of Understanding 
          between the Government of Canada and the Government of Alberta, 
          about collaboration on safety and efficiency of resource extraction, 
          which as you can imagine, is a key activity in this region.</p>
        <p>You see, in the field of clean energy there&rsquo;s overlap between federal and provincial responsibilities 
          and that means we need to partner and collaborate effectively 
          to make it work smoothly, and, of course, to get results for Canadians.</p>
        <p>Lately, I have been working on organizing a meeting with a team from Innovation Alberta 
          and science reps from <abbr>NRCan</abbr> to get going on work that focuses on cleaner energy. </p>
        <p>So on this file, my team is acting as a bridge that connects the provincial team 
          from the Government of Alberta and <abbr>NRCan</abbr> science and policy people for the first time. </p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s really interesting because we work in different organizations with different mandates, 
          but we get to work together on similar objectives, 
          creating unique partnerships between people and between organizations, too. </p>
        <p>So – pulling it together: I coordinated a day and time with everyone, 
          and then set up a videoconference and a solid agenda – 
          making sure that everyone had what they&rsquo;d need for a productive meeting. </p>
        <p>Now, these meetings are important forums for us to collaborate 
          on shared areas of federal and provincial responsibilities. </p>
        <p>And since these relationships are important in achieving desired outcomes, 
          you can bet that it&rsquo;s critical to do everything we can to strengthen these partnerships. </p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s a real… &ldquo;meeting of the minds.&rdquo;   So, why take all this care about a single meeting? </p>
        <p>Well, because it&rsquo;s… unchartered territory… and how this first meeting relating to the <abbr>MOU</abbr> goes 
          will really drive the rest of the partnership going forward.</p>
        <p>So, what am I learning? </p>
        <p>I&rsquo;m learning about the importance of federal and provincial collaboration on government priorities. </p>
        <p>And I&rsquo;m learning about bringing people together and making it all work, which is fascinating. </p>
        <p>And, of course, at the end of the day, what we do, both at the federal and provincial level, 
          is all about working to serve Canadians… 
          which is very satisfying.  </p>
