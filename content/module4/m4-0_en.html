    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>Sometimes, the federal and provincial governments collaborate on activities related to investment and infrastructure. As a public servant, you are responsible for collaborating with external stakeholders and contributing to the success of such cooperative projects.</p>

    <p>Often, prior to engaging in initiatives with outside organizations, a department is required to formalize the agreement. A Memorandum of Understanding (<abbr>MOU</abbr>) describes a bilateral or multilateral agreement that enables a department to engage in collaboration with another department or organization to work on a common line of action.</p>

    <p>Government of Canada departments and agencies are also responsible for understanding how and when their activities could have an adverse impact on Indigenous and treaty rights. In addition, strong partnerships among Indigenous Peoples, governments and the private sector are emerging as we address outstanding land claim and treaty issues and work toward self-government. </p>

    <p>Upon completion of this module, you should be able to:  </p>
    <ul>
        <li>explain the importance of collaborating with provincial and Indigenous governments</li>
        <li>identify a tool used to formalize agreements outside of your department</li>
    </ul>
