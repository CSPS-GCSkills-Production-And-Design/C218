    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>The Government of Canada provides service and support to its citizens to build the economy and improve the health and the wellbeing of Canadians. As a public servant, you may be responsible for providing service directly to Canadians.</p>

    <p>Departments vary in the services they provide, but our ultimate goal is to serve Canadians.</p>

    <p>For example, Employment and Social Development Canada delivers many services that make a difference in the lives of Canadians. Its mission is to build a stronger and more competitive Canada, to support Canadians in making choices that help them live productive and rewarding lives, and to improve Canadians’ quality of life. </p>

    <p>It develops policies that make Canada a society in which everyone can use their talents, skills, and resources to learn, work, and contribute to their community. It also creates programs and supporting initiatives that help Canadians move through life’s transitions.</p>

    <p>As another example, all federal government departments share responsibility for meeting the Government of Canada's obligations and commitments, including treaty obligations, to First Nations, Inuit and Métis, and for fulfilling the federal government's constitutional responsibilities in the North. </p>
