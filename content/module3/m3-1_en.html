            <h2 class="h4">Public servants provide service to Canadians that help them reach their potential.</h2>
            <h2 class="h4">The Foreign Credential Recognition Program provides Canadians with the ability to earn accreditation for formal education completed outside of Canada.</h2>
            <p>I work for Employment and Social  Development Canada in Vancouver.</p>
            <p>Why do I have the best job in the world? </p>
            <p> Let me tell you about it. </p>
            <p> When I decided to become a Federal Public  Servant, 
            I knew I wanted to have a job where I could  have real impact on real people. </p>
            <p> So I looked for a job that had an element  of direct service – 
            you know, actually working with clients –  and Service Canada was the ticket. </p>
            <p> They have a philosophy that&rsquo;s really centered  on the principles of service excellence 
            and the whole organization is committed to  it. </p>
            <p> So as a Service Canada specialist, I handle  files on various issues. </p>
            <p> But it isn&rsquo;t files… it&rsquo;s about people…  families. And every case is different. </p>
            <p> For instance, I&rsquo;m working on an initiative  called the Foreign Credential Recognition program 
            where we help Canadians get their foreign  credentials recognized so they can work in Canada.</p>
            <p> So, let&rsquo;s say a client who is a physician  is in the process of relocating to Canada. </p>
            <p> He or she could be partway through the  immigration process, 
            and wants to find work as a doctor but his  or her credentials are not yet recognized.</p>
            <p> I actually have a client with a situation  like this. </p>
            <p> I&rsquo;ve spoken with him a few times by phone,  but yesterday he came to see me, 
            and we&rsquo;re working together to get him  connected.  </p>
            <p> This program brings different departments  together, 
              like Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship  Canada, Service Canada, 
              and other parts of Employment and Social  Development Canada 
            to work through Service Canada&rsquo;s &ldquo;single  window&rdquo; policy.</p>
            <p>It&rsquo;s a great example of what happens when  departments work seamlessly together 
            so that clients don&rsquo;t have to go to each  one separately. </p>
            <p> And THAT makes it way easier for people  like this client. </p>
            <p> Sometimes the file is quite complex, but  often my client just needs some guidance or advice… 
              but no matter what, it&rsquo;s always about  important things: 
            helping families, providing Social  Insurance Numbers or issuing passports... new beginnings.  </p>
            <p> You know what? This was my family, thirty  years ago. </p>
            <p> The things my own parents and aunts and  uncles struggled through. </p>
            <p> And I get to help people – help them  understand how to obtain the services they need, … 
              and boy, is that satisfying.  </p>
