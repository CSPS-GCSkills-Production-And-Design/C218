        <h2 class="h4">An Answer Card is one of the tools the department uses to provide information to a Minister.</h2>
        <h2 class="h4">The purpose of an answer card is to help the Minister respond to questions raised in Parliament.</h2>
        <p>I&rsquo;ve been a Federal Government policy analyst 
          with Parks Canada for about three years now. </p>
        <p>I work for Parks Canada, and I&rsquo;m with the parliamentary affairs team. </p>
        <p>Typical day? Well, there&rsquo;s no such thing - so… 
          let me talk about the last… twenty-eight hours or so.</p>
        <p>Where to begin…
          Well, we got wind yesterday morning at about 8:30 that there MIGHT be a question in Question Period, 
          and that our Minister would need an Answer Card for Question Period, 
          and that the subject would be the legislating of Nááts&rsquo;ihch&rsquo;oh National Park Reserve in the Northwest Territories.</p>
        <p>Usually, when we know what the subject matter will be, we huddle… 
          and then we figure out where to get the expertise that will give us the answers the Minister is going to need. </p>
        <p>So in this particular case, we identified Dominic, who works for Parks Canada in Tulita, <abbr>NT</abbr>.</p>
        <p>After all, if anybody would know how to interpret what is going on, it would be Dominic, 
          since he&rsquo;s spent the last few years negotiating the Impact and Benefit Plan for the park 
          and has almost ten years interpreting policy.</p>
        <p>Dominic is also First Nations himself and knows the local context, as well as being our Ministry expert. </p>
        <p>I was assigned the job of talking with him.  </p>
        <p>Now time is ticking, right – since it&rsquo;s a Tuesday, Question Period in the House will be at 2:15… 
          and it&rsquo;s 9:45. So the pressure&rsquo;s on!  </p>
        <p>I set up a videoconference with Dominic and we just went hard at it, 
          knowing that we needed to pull together key relevant information in point form – 
          oh… without leaving anything out, of course!</p>
        <p>Preparing the Card began with a few points about the Canada National Parks Act, 
          to show that maintenance of ecological integrity is the first priority of the Minister, 
          and then we looked at the IBP which has been negotiated with the local Aboriginal groups.</p>
        <p>Then we added in that Canada, and in particular Parks Canada is an international leader in developing respectful, 
          trusting relationships with aboriginal peoples. </p>
        <p>This park was created with the Aboriginal people of the Sahtu and will be managed cooperatively with them.</p>
        <p>So… I&rsquo;m writing stuff down furiously, 
          and Dominic is sending pictures to show the boundaries and files for support as we&rsquo;re having this conversation. </p>
        <p>We finish up and say goodbye.</p>
        <p>I look at my watch, and… it&rsquo;s 10:30! </p>
        <p>I get the Card formatted and run – and I mean actually RUN – straight over to the VP&rsquo;s office, 
          to be sure it gets to the Minister right away. </p>
        <p>I look at my watch one more time… 11:07. 
          I think that&rsquo;s a personal best! </p>
        <p>So, yeah… that was my last day and a bit. </p>
        <p>You know, this is the stuff I live for: 
          high energy, helping with the governance of our country in… well, basically in real time. </p>
        <p>It just doesn&rsquo;t get any better than that! </p>
