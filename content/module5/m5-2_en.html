	<h1>Communications between the Political and Public Service Sides of Government Departments</h1>
    <p>Communications between the political side of a department (i.e. the minister’s office) and the departmental staff flow through the deputy minister’s office; the deputy minister is responsible for managing complex sets of sensitive issues.</p>
    <p>Question Period takes place at 14:15 Eastern Standard Time (<abbr>EST</abbr>), Monday through Thursday, and at 11:15 <abbr>EST</abbr> on Friday, every day that Parliament is in session. During Question Period, which is aired on the Cable Public Affairs Channel (<abbr>CPAC</abbr>), ministers respond to questions from the floor.</p>
    <p>A department, under the direction of the deputy minister’s office, has the responsibility of ensuring that the minister receives appropriate information and briefing on all departmental activities. Departments may work with their minister’s offices in preparing responses for delivery in Question Period. These responses are known as “Answer Cards.”</p>
