	<h1>Accountable to Canadians</h1>
    <p>Ministers are accountable to the House of Commons for all actions carried out in their name because, under our Constitution, this is where elected officials are also made responsible to the citizens of Canada.  One of the ways ministers account to the House is through their answers in Question Period.</p>
    <p>Ministerial accountability requires ministers to take responsibility for their mistakes and ensure that the government takes appropriate remedial action. Although pressure from opposition benches may be intense, a minister is not required to resign simply by acknowledging a mistake.</p>
