        Federal departments, in collaboration with the provinces and territories, play a vital role in monitoring and improving the country's climate and environment.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:09.50" end="00:00:12.72" style="1">
        ♫ ♫<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:12.72" end="00:00:18.24" style="1">
        I’m a Science Officer at Environment and Climate Change Canada.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:18.24" end="00:00:20.76" style="1">
        So… you want me to describe what I do?<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:20.76" end="00:00:24.05" style="1">
        Well… yesterday was pretty much a Kodak moment!<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:24.05" end="00:00:26.70" style="1">
        In fact, I wanted to take a group shot for a team picture…<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:26.70" end="00:00:31.90" style="1">
        because it was a perfect example of a pretty much perfect day!<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:31.90" end="00:00:35.20" style="1">
        You see, my team works on improving water quality.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:35.20" end="00:00:39.15" style="1">
        Water is our most precious natural resource, and both the Federal government<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:39.15" end="00:00:46.91" style="1">
        and the provinces have made it a long term priority to improve Canada’s lakes, rivers, and oceans too.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:46.91" end="00:00:51.96" style="1">
        Now on the St. Lawrence, certain products and by-products have created unintended circumstances<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:51.96" end="00:00:55.44" style="1">
        by making their way in to the River and shores over the years,<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:55.44" end="00:01:00.27" style="1">
        and have also contaminated surrounding wetlands, like Lake St. Pierre.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:00.27" end="00:01:06.16" style="1">
        And we’re tackling that with full force - a dream scenario for a biologist.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:06.16" end="00:01:08.27" style="1">
        I remember sitting in first year biochemistry<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:08.27" end="00:01:11.46" style="1">
        thinking of how or when all this was going to be put in to practice.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:11.46" end="00:01:14.44" style="1">
        And now…I’m doing it!<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:14.44" end="00:01:17.82" style="1">
        Anyway… back to yesterday!!<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:17.82" end="00:01:26.11" style="1">
        I started out by picking up my gear and supplies, met up with my team<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:26.11" end="00:01:30.71" style="1">
        and headed out to the collection site on the St. Lawrence.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:30.71" end="00:01:35.77" style="1">
        We normally spend the morning doing a series of onsite tests.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:35.77" end="00:01:41.10" style="1">
        So there we were, heading back out to the collection site for more samples.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:41.10" end="00:01:46.62" style="1">
        And by the way, we’re speaking nothing but French.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:46.62" end="00:01:52.92" style="1">
        Maybe not a big deal to some people, but huge for me – I’m from Saskatchewan and I’m still learning!<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:52.92" end="00:01:55.74" style="1">
        It’s critical - I need to make sure that I can talk with people<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:55.74" end="00:02:00.37" style="1">
        in the language of their choice and in this region, it tends to be French.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:00.37" end="00:02:04.47" style="1">
        By the way, we often have students from France and various Quebec universities,<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:04.47" end="00:02:09.47" style="1">
        so it’s a pretty lively environment as well as a great “language lab”!<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:09.47" end="00:02:12.77" style="1">
        Around 1:00 o’clock we get back to the office where our main labs are.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:12.77" end="00:02:16.72" style="1">
        We select samples according to different analytical protocols.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:16.72" end="00:02:20.12" style="1">
        3 o’clock rolls around and the Research manager asks for an update<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:20.12" end="00:02:23.52" style="1">
        so he can brief up the Regional Director responsible for this initiative,<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:23.52" end="00:02:26.87" style="1">
        and the Director General of Water Science and technology responsible<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:26.87" end="00:02:29.67" style="1">
        for water quality monitoring and research.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:29.67" end="00:02:33.12" style="1">
        Done… and done.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:33.12" end="00:02:36.78" style="1">
        It’s pretty clear that a lot of people are really interested in this work.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:36.78" end="00:02:41.58" style="1">
        The government of Canada has enlisted the help from the departments of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada,<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:41.58" end="00:02:46.03" style="1">
        Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Health Canada, Parks Canada Agency,<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:46.03" end="00:02:50.63" style="1">
        Public Health Agency of Canada and us, Environment and Climate Change Canada.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:50.63" end="00:02:56.69" style="1">
        And… the government of Quebec has enlisted help from five of their departments, too.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:56.69" end="00:02:59.79" style="1">
        Just to close off the day yesterday, I talked to my provincial counterpart<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:59.79" end="00:03:04.59" style="1">
        for planning a joint field campaign including working in tributaries of the St. Lawrence,<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:03:04.59" end="00:03:06.98" style="1">
        then we all headed up to tell the regional director<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:03:06.98" end="00:03:13.13" style="1">
        and our DG about how far we’ve come and the successes of the project.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:03:13.13" end="00:03:19.08" style="1">
        Whenever I start talking about what we do here and why we do it, people’s eyes just light up.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:03:19.08" end="00:03:24.93" style="1">
        Maybe because it’s an example of how we can cooperate and get amazing stuff done.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:03:24.93" end="00:03:30.58" style="1">
        So… I’m working on a great file, I’m working in environmental science, I’m working outdoors,<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:03:30.58" end="00:03:33.44" style="1">
        I’m on a project that is critical to Canada’s future…<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:03:33.44" end="00:03:36.50" style="1">
        and I get to work on my French every day.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:03:36.50" end="00:03:38.72" style="1">
        Not bad, right?<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:03:38.72" end="00:03:43.72" style="1">
