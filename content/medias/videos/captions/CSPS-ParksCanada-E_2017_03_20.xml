       An Answer Card is one of the tools the department uses to provide information to a Minister.<br/>
       The purpose of an answer card is to help the Minister respond to questions raised in Parliament.

        I’ve been a Federal Government policy analyst<br/>

        with Parks Canada for about three years now.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:19.93" end="00:00:24.12" style="1">
        I work for Parks Canada, and I’m with the parliamentary affairs team.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:24.12" end="00:00:28.08" style="1">
        Typical day? Well, there’s no such thing - so…<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:28.08" end="00:00:32.46" style="1">
        let me talk about the last… twenty-eight hours or so.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.46" end="00:00:39.23" style="1">
        Where to begin…<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:39.23" end="00:00:45.33" style="1">
        Well, we got wind yesterday morning at about 8:30 that there MIGHT be a question in Question Period,<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:45.33" end="00:00:48.48" style="1">
        and that our Minister would need an Answer Card for Question Period,<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:48.48" end="00:00:56.74" style="1">
        and that the subject would be the legislating of Nááts’ihch’oh National Park Reserve in the Northwest Territories<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:56.74" end="00:01:00.36" style="1">
        Usually, when we know what the subject matter will be, we huddle…<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:00.36" end="00:01:05.61" style="1">
        and then we figure out where to get the expertise that will give use the answers the Minister is going to need.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:05.61" end="00:01:11.72" style="1">
        So in this particular case, we identified Dominic, who works for Parks Canada in Tulita, NT.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:11.72" end="00:01:16.62" style="1">
        After all, if anybody would know how to interpret what is going on, it would be Dominic,<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:16.62" end="00:01:21.32" style="1">
        since he’s spent the last few years negotiating the Impact and Benefit Plan for the park<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:21.32" end="00:01:23.88" style="1">
        and has almost ten years interpreting policy.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:23.88" end="00:01:30.67" style="1">
        Dominic is also First Nations himself and knows the local context, as well as<br/>
        being our Ministry expert.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:30.67" end="00:01:33.40" style="1">
        I was assigned the job of talking with him.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:33.40" end="00:01:39.15" style="1">
        Now time is ticking, right – since it’s a Tuesday, Question Period in the House will be at 2:15…<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:39.15" end="00:01:44.50" style="1">
        and it’s 9:45. So the pressure’s on!<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:44.50" end="00:01:48.05" style="1">
        I set up a videoconference with Dominic and we just went hard at it,<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:48.05" end="00:01:52.91" style="1">
        knowing that we needed to pull together key relevant information in point form –<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:52.91" end="00:01:57.66" style="1">
        oh… without leaving anything out, of course!<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:57.66" end="00:02:02.20" style="1">
        Preparing the Card began with a few points about the Canada National Parks Act,<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:02.20" end="00:02:08.97" style="1">
        to show that maintenance of ecological integrity is the first priority of the Minister,<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:08.97" end="00:02:14.16" style="1">
        and then we looked at the IBP which has been negotiated with the local Aboriginal groups.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:14.16" end="00:02:20.86" style="1">
        Then we added in that Canada, and in particular Parks Canada is an international leader in developing respectful,<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:20.86" end="00:02:24.72" style="1">
        trusting relationships with aboriginal peoples.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:24.72" end="00:02:31.32" style="1">
        This park was created with the Aboriginal people of the Sahtu and will be managed cooperatively with them.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:31.32" end="00:02:34.16" style="1">
        So… I’m writing stuff down furiously,<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:34.16" end="00:02:41.41" style="1">
        and Dominic is sending pictures to show the boundaries and files for support as we’re having this conversation.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:41.41" end="00:02:43.76" style="1">
        We finish up and say goodbye.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:43.76" end="00:02:47.66" style="1">
        I look at my watch, and… it’s 10:30!<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:47.66" end="00:02:54.86" style="1">
        I get the Card formatted and run – and I mean actually RUN – straight over to the VP’s office,<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:54.86" end="00:02:59.92" style="1">
        to be sure it gets to the Minister right away.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:59.92" end="00:03:03.82" style="1">
        I look at my watch one more time… 11:07.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:03:03.82" end="00:03:05.82" style="1">
        I think that’s a personal best!<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:03:05.82" end="00:03:09.50" style="1">
        So, yeah… that was my last day and a bit.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:03:09.50" end="00:03:11.77" style="1">
        You know, this is the stuff I live for:<br/>

      <p begin="00:03:11.77" end="00:03:16.48" style="1">
        high energy, helping with the governance of our country in… well, basically in real time.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:03:16.48" end="00:03:19.17" style="1">
        It just doesn’t get any better than that!<br/>
