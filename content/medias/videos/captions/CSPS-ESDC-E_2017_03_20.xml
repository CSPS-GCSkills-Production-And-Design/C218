        Public servants provide service to Canadians that help them reach their potential.<br/>
        The Foreign Credential Recognition Program provides Canadians with the ability to earn accreditation for formal education completed outside of Canada.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:14.60" end="00:00:21.26" style="1">
        I work for Employment and Social Development Canada in Vancouver.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:21.26" end="00:00:23.23" style="1">
        Why do I have the best job in the world?<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:23.23" end="00:00:27.27" style="1">
        Let me tell you about it.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:27.27" end="00:00:29.47" style="1">
        When I decided to become a Federal Public Servant,<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:29.47" end="00:00:34.98" style="1">
        I knew I wanted to have a job where I could have real impact on real people.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:34.98" end="00:00:38.43" style="1">
        So I looked for a job that had an element of direct service –<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:38.43" end="00:00:45.13" style="1">
        you know, actually working with clients – and Service Canada was the ticket.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:45.13" end="00:00:50.97" style="1">
        They have a philosophy that’s really centered on the principles of service excellence<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:50.97" end="00:00:54.37" style="1">
        and the whole organization is committed to it.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:54.37" end="00:00:59.03" style="1">
        So as a Service Canada specialist, I handle files on various issues.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:59.03" end="00:01:04.93" style="1">
        But it isn’t files… it’s about people… families.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:04.93" end="00:01:08.18" style="1">
        And every case is different.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:08.18" end="00:01:12.79" style="1">
        For instance, I’m working on an initiative called the Foreign Credential Recognition program<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:12.79" end="00:01:18.69" style="1">
        where we help Canadians get their foreign credentials recognized so they can work in Canada.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:18.69" end="00:01:23.68" style="1">
        So, let’s say a client who is a physician is in the process of relocating to Canada.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:23.68" end="00:01:26.50" style="1">
        He or she could be partway through the immigration process,<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:26.50" end="00:01:32.34" style="1">
        and wants to find work as a doctor but his or her credentials are not yet recognized.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:32.34" end="00:01:35.73" style="1">
        I actually have a client with a situation like this.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:35.73" end="00:01:40.14" style="1">
        I’ve spoken with him a few times by phone, but yesterday he came to see me,<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:40.14" end="00:01:44.34" style="1">
        and we’re working together to get him connected.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:44.34" end="00:01:46.69" style="1">
        This program brings different departments together,<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:46.69" end="00:01:51.29" style="1">
        like Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, Service Canada,<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:51.29" end="00:01:54.19" style="1">
        and other parts of Employment and Social Development Canada<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:54.19" end="00:01:58.09" style="1">
        to work through Service Canada’s “single window” policy.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:58.09" end="00:02:02.84" style="1">
        It’s a great example of what happens when departments work seamlessly together<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:02.84" end="00:02:06.04" style="1">
        so that clients don’t have to go to each one separately.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:06.04" end="00:02:12.70" style="1">
        And THAT makes it way easier for people like this client.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:12.70" end="00:02:18.49" style="1">
        Sometimes the file is quite complex, but often my client just needs some guidance or advice…<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:18.49" end="00:02:22.09" style="1">
        but no matter what, it’s always about important things:<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:22.09" end="00:02:34.74" style="1">
        helping families, providing Social Insurance Numbers or issuing passports... new beginnings.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:34.74" end="00:02:38.05" style="1">
        You know what? This was my family, thirty years ago.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:38.05" end="00:02:42.49" style="1">
        The things my own parents and aunts and uncles struggled through.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:42.49" end="00:02:47.80" style="1">
        And I get to help people – help them understand how to obtain the services they need, …<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:47.80" end="00:02:52.80" style="1">
        and boy, is that satisfying.<br/>
