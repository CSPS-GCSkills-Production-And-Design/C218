        The Government of Canada's relationships with its provinces and territories are very important.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:09.24" end="00:00:13.96" style="1">
        I’m 37, Bachelor in Environmental Studies, born in Toronto,<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:13.96" end="00:00:19.48" style="1">
        living in Edmonton working for Natural Resources Canada, and loving it.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:19.48" end="00:00:22.84" style="1">
        So you’re asking me what I do: good question.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:22.84" end="00:00:26.96" style="1">
        I think the best description is that I solve puzzles,<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:26.96" end="00:00:34.28" style="1">
        but the puzzles have to do with people and organizations and policy.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:34.28" end="00:00:38.80" style="1">
        And one of the coolest files I am working on relates to a Memorandum of Understanding<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:38.80" end="00:00:41.80" style="1">
        between the Government of Canada and the Government of Alberta,<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:41.80" end="00:00:46.34" style="1">
        about collaboration on safety and efficiency of resource extraction,<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:46.34" end="00:00:50.96" style="1">
        which as you can imagine, is a key activity in this region.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:50.96" end="00:00:56.74" style="1">
        You see, in the field of clean energy there’s overlap between federal and provincial responsibilities<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:56.74" end="00:01:00.30" style="1">
        and that means we need to partner and collaborate effectively<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:00.30" end="00:01:06.24" style="1">
        to make it work smoothly, and, of course, to get results for Canadians.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:06.24" end="00:01:10.80" style="1">
        Lately, I have been working on organizing a meeting with a team from Innovation Alberta<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:10.80" end="00:01:16.60" style="1">
        and science reps from NRCan to get going on work that focuses on cleaner energy.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:16.60" end="00:01:21.76" style="1">
        So on this file, my team is acting as a bridge that connects the provincial team<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:21.76" end="00:01:27.18" style="1">
        from the Government of Alberta and NRCAN science and policy people for the first time.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:27.18" end="00:01:32.64" style="1">
        It’s really interesting because we work in different organizations with different mandates,<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:32.64" end="00:01:35.16" style="1">
        but we get to work together on similar objectives,<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:35.16" end="00:01:42.90" style="1">
        creating unique partnerships between people and between organizations, too.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:42.90" end="00:01:47.26" style="1">
        So – pulling it together: I coordinated a day and time with everyone,<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:47.26" end="00:01:50.54" style="1">
        and then set up a videoconference and a solid agenda –<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:50.54" end="00:01:55.02" style="1">
        making sure that everyone had what they’d need for a productive meeting.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:55.02" end="00:01:58.66" style="1">
        Now, these meetings are important forums for us to collaborate<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:01:58.66" end="00:02:02.46" style="1">
        on shared areas of federal and provincial responsibilities.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:02.46" end="00:02:06.78" style="1">
        And since these relationships are important in achieving desired outcomes,<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:06.78" end="00:02:11.38" style="1">
        you can bet that it’s critical to do everything we can to strengthen these partnerships.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:11.38" end="00:02:16.16" style="1">
        It’s a real… “meeting of the minds.”<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:16.16" end="00:02:19.42" style="1">
        So, why take all this care about a single meeting?<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:19.42" end="00:02:25.84" style="1">
        Well, because it’s… unchartered territory… and how this first meeting relating to the MOU goes<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:25.84" end="00:02:29.82" style="1">
        will really drive the rest of the partnership going forward.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:29.82" end="00:02:31.28" style="1">
        What am I learning?<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:31.28" end="00:02:36.58" style="1">
        I’m learning about the importance of federal and provincial collaboration on government priorities.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:36.58" end="00:02:41.84" style="1">
        And I’m learning about bringing people together and making it all work, which is fascinating.<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:41.84" end="00:02:46.86" style="1">
        And, of course, at the end of the day, what we do, both at the federal and provincial level,<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:46.86" end="00:02:49.00" style="1">
        is all about working to serve Canadians…<br/>
        
      </p>
      <p begin="00:02:49.00" end="00:02:54.00" style="1">
        which is very satisfying.<br/>
